## Creating File 
After creating issue you can work on it. 
 1. If you are creating a new file, name it with problemcode. Ex- ```CV.ABC``` where CV is problem code and ABC is language extension.
 2. Every file should follow the template -->
 
 ```
 
 Problem Link - <URL>
 Time Taken - <TIME TAKEN>
 
 Actual Code...

```

Problem link and time taken should be comment out in the file.

Ex ->

```python

 #Problem Link - https://www.codechef.com/LTIME72B/problems/CV
 #Time Taken - 0.1s
 
 def calc():
    s = input()
    if num==1:
        return(0)
 ...
 ```
This code will be save as CV.py
